# self-water-planter

This project is a self-watering planting system using a [Seeed Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html). You can find some photos at the [blog post](http://lindsayrgwatt.com/blog/2021/02/plants-without-the-effort/) I wrote up about the project.

Here's the sensor & compute BOM:

* Computer: [Seeed Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html)
* Water level sensor: [Seeed Grove Water Level Sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Water-Level-Sensor-10CM-p-4443.html)
* Capacitive moisture sensor: [DFRobot Gravity Analog Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1385.html)
* Relay: [Seeed Grove Relay](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Relay.html)

Other physical items:

* I pulled the pump from an old kit; if you search for "water pump" on Seeed or DFRobot you'll find many options
* To distribute water I used an old piece of broken drip distribution tubing; just drilled some holes in it where I wanted water to come out faster
* To mount the Wio Terminal and and the water level sensor in place I 3D printed some brackets; the .stl files are part of this github repo

If you find this useful, let me know.
